**Today's Progress:**
Note: Already on the _Basic CSS_ section since I actually started a few days ago.
- Maybe I already forgot this but I learned that an `id` has a higher specificity than a `class`. Since there's no code to push, here's my 100 day commitment [post](https://twitter.com/johnmmweb/status/1025618060483280896).
- Learned about another custom CSS selector (and it's syntax) by styling the margin around a checkbox.
```CSS
  [type='checkbox'] {
    margin: 10px 15px 10px 15px;
  }
```
- I knew about the `px`, percentage `%` and `em` measurements but I either forgot about or didn't know about the `in` and `mm` options I could use.

**Thoughts:** While I could fly through this CSS stuff, I'm trying to take it slower so hopefully some of this stuff will sink in deeper.

**Link to work:** No code yet. Working on the basics still. Here's my Twitter [post]().

**Today's Progress**
- Completed the Data Structures checkpoint number 1.
- Learned more about stacks and queues.
- I'm jumping around between the data structures, algorithms and relational db fundamentals modules. I started reading checkpoint 10 of the db module which discusses normalization and denormalization.

**Thoughts:** Learned that classes are a way to structure [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type). I'm still hazy on how Ruby classes are formed and when to do initialization and when to make methods private.

**Link to work:**
Here's the latest [repo](https://github.com/jmuldvp/bloc-data-structures) for my data structures work.
