# My Rules modifications for the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
August 3rd, 2018

## Additional Rules
1. I don't agree with the original rule 5 which states...
_I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge._

I'm participating in an online coding camp right now and I feel if I state what I'm doing and I keep a log, I'll retain what I learn a lot more than if I don't. I have to read other tutorials and documentation to complete my schooling. I feel if I keep a log and I know that I'm going to have to make a public post, it'll keep me honest.

While I'm truly grateful for the folks that put together freeCodeCamp, I'm going to be following along with their program but also following along with other websites as well.
