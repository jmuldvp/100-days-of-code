Learned that these 3 lines are the same..

```ruby
p 10 / 5
p 10./(5)
p 10.div(5)
```

Glad I stuck with listening to the basics on this udemy course.  I had no idea about the second and third line.  It wasn't taught in any of the beginners courses I took before.

I wanted my Star Wars day to be memorable and it kind of was given I'm trying to learn more about Docker so that I can setup an Eclipse Che environment or figure out how to get a free Cloud9 AWS account to start an actual Rails project.

I learned more of the basic stuff in the Learn to Code with Ruby course.  Really nothing new there in the material I was able to get through today.

I'm still following along with the Learn to Code with Ruby class.  I'm still watching it 2x because I know most everything they are going over.

There is a method that I skimmed by before in a tutorial or maybe I saw it in a book which is the `respond_to?` method. I've never seen examples of it the way I saw it in the video. It's pretty cool in that it can be used to help clean or check on data before it's used or consumed.

Here are some examples..
```Ruby
if num.respond_to?("length") # false won't run
  num.next
end
puts
puts "Hello".respond_to?("length")
puts "Hello".respond_to?("class")
puts "Hello".respond_to?("upcase")
puts "Hello".respond_to?("odd?")
puts
# Using a symbol instead
puts "Hello".respond_to?(:length)
puts "Hello".respond_to?(:downcase)
puts 1.respond_to?(:next)
# Using the symbol object takes up less memory in Ruby
```

**Today's Progress:**
Made more progress through the Ruby course.  Learned a few things about ranges and `rand`.  I even had another opportunity to code out another "FizzBuzz" challenge.
