Learned that these 3 lines are the same..

```ruby
p 10 / 5
p 10./(5)
p 10.div(5)
```

Glad I stuck with listening to the basics on this udemy course.  I had no idea about the second and third line.  It wasn't taught in any of the beginners courses I took before.

I wanted my Star Wars day to be memorable and it kind of was given I'm trying to learn more about Docker so that I can setup an Eclipse Che environment or figure out how to get a free Cloud9 AWS account to start an actual Rails project.

I learned more of the basic stuff in the Learn to Code with Ruby course.  Really nothing new there in the material I was able to get through today.
